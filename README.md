[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kimyou1994/itp404-final-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kimyou1994/itp404-final-project)
1. I wanted to use yelp api to search for business info but couldn't connect nodejs to ember so i
hardcoded the data
2. The primary audience would be anyone who need business info
3. REST apis would be satisfied with making a profile that would allow users to save and delete any
information that they would like to obtain.
4. One additional addon I used is google map which allow to view map using latitude and longitude
